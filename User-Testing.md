#User Testing 4/30/2018

We focused on testing the glove (which was not tested during the last user tests) with the participant. They were assisted in putting on the glove and given a brief 
explanation of the purpose of the device (a glove to help people with dyspraxia and grip issues train their grip).

The user commented that:
- The flatness of the pressure sensors made it awkward to try to grip objects (they felt they had to modify their grip for the program to recognize 
their grip, even if they were holding onto it with similar firmness). They suggested placing the sensors inside or adhering them more
tightly to the outside so that they followed the natural shape of the finger.
- The glove thickness made it harder for them to sense how firmly they were gripping.
- When asked for comments about the UI, they said it seemed fairly obvious to them what the desired behavior was, 
as the numbers would increase with more pressure and light up green (along with the "ding" sound) when the desired grip was achieved.

As the person conductiing the user test, I noticed that:
- The user was not sure which hand to put the glove on because it was not immediately obvious that the attachments were pressure sensors and needed
to be at the finger pad side rather than the nailbed side. Some more explanation about the glove before a demo might help 
solve this. A different glove design could also make this more obvious.
